## DOCKER

Containers:

1. Frontend Container (React.js)
2. Backend Container (Node.js & Express.js)
3. Database Container (MongoDB)
4. Judge Container (Code execution and evaluation)

Purpose

- Ensures consistency across environments
- Simplifies deployment
- Isolates the code execution for security

## SECURITY MEASURES

1. Using Docker containers to run user-submitted code in a secure, isolated environment
2. Implementing CPU and memory usage limits for code execution to prevent resource abuse
3. Thoroughly validating all user inputs, especially in code submissions
4. Ensures all API communications use HTTPS for secure data transfer
5. Ensures API connect at time of authentication and authorization

## CODE EVALUATION SYSTEM

1. Execute code written in various programming languages
2. Compare program output with expected results to determine correctness
3. Provide feedback on code performance and correctness (test cases passed or not)


## ANTI-CHEATING MEASURE

1. limit copy-paste actions within the code editor
2. Ensuring the user remains engaged with the coding environment.


## REPORTING SYSTEM

### 1. Features

- Logging the details of potential cheating incidents
- display warnings for minor violations
- using flag for severe or repeated violations for manual review
- user agreement page explaining anti-cheating measures before starting the contest

### 2. API Endpoints

- POST /api/contest/log-violation: to log the potential cheating incidents
- GET /api/admin/violation-reports: to retrieve the violation reports for admin review


## CHALLENGES

- Providing instant feedback on code submissions while handling multiple concurrent users can be resource-intensive and complex
    - Soltion: Using lightweight Docker containers to run code execution processes, as containers can be spun up and down quickly, ensuring scalability and isolation
- Supporting multiple programming languages with varying runtime environments and requirements
    - Solution: Developing a modular execution framework where each programming language has a dedicated Docker image configured with the necessary environment
- Scaling the platform to handle peak loads during user traffic without degrading performance
    - Solution: Deploying the application on a cloud platform (AWS) with auto-scaling capabilities to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
- Executing the user-submitted code securely to prevent malicious activities and resource abuse
    - Solution: Implementing code sandboxing techniques to isolate code execution from the main system, thereby preventing any harmful code from accessing sensitive system resources
